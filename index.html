		<h2 id="elephants">Elephants</h2>
		As a man was passing the elephants, he suddenly stopped, confused by the fact that these huge creatures were being held by only a small rope tied to their front leg. No chains, no cages. It was obvious that the elephants could, at anytime, break away from their bonds but for some reason, they did not.

	He saw a trainer nearby and asked why these animals just stood there and made no attempt to get away. “Well,” trainer said, “when they are very young and much smaller we use the same size rope to tie them and, at that age, it’s enough to hold them. As they grow up, they are conditioned to believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can still hold them, so they never try to break free.”

	The man was amazed. These animals could at any time break free from their bonds but because they believed they couldn’t, they were stuck right where they were.

	Like the elephants, how many of us go through life hanging onto a belief that we cannot do something, simply because we failed at it once before?

	Failure is part of learning; we should never give up the struggle in life.

			The right place
		</h2>
		A mother and a baby camel were lying around under a tree.

		Then the baby camel asked, “Why do camels have humps?”

		The mother camel considered this and said, “We are desert animals so we have the humps to store water so we can survive with very little water.”

		The baby camel thought for a moment then said, “Ok…why are our legs long and our feet rounded?”

		The mama replied, “They are meant for walking in the desert.”

		The baby paused. After a beat, the camel asked, “Why are our eyelashes long? Sometimes they get in my way.”

		The mama responded, “Those long thick eyelashes protect your eyes from the desert sand when it blows in the wind.

		The baby thought and thought. Then he said, “I see. So the hump is to store water when we are in the desert, the legs are for walking through the desert and these eye lashes protect my eyes from the desert then why in the Zoo?”
